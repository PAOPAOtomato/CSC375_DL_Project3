# Project 3 ‚Äì CSC 375 Deep Learning

> üîÄ **Note**: All project content is in the `master` branch.

## Overview

This repository contains two parts of Project 3 for the course CSC 375/675: Neural Networks & Deep Learning. The focus is on applying deep learning techniques to computer vision and time series analysis tasks.

### üìÅ Main Files

- `CSC375_Project3_Part1.ipynb`:  
  Implements and compares object detection models (YOLOv3 and ResNet50) on the VisDrone dataset. Includes model evaluation, performance metrics, and visualization.

- `Part2_time_series.ipynb`:  
  Applies deep learning methods to time series forecasting, including preprocessing, model training, and evaluation on sequential data.

## Dependencies

- Python ‚â• 3.8  
- PyTorch  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow (for optional parts)  
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Running the Code
